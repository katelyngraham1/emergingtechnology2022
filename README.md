# Emerging Technology
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);" />

For my 4th Year module [Emerging Technologies](https://www.gmit.ie/emerging-technologies), I have created this repository. In the repository you will find 5 Jupyter Notbooks which cover a specific set of topics. Each notebook details sub headings which are related to the main topic. 
<br><br>
<b>The 5 Notebook Topics are:</b><br>
    1. GitHub Pages<br>
    2. Jupyter Lite<br>
    3. Computation<br>
    4. Fourier Transform<br>
    5. Quantum Computing
<br><br>
